# Digital Design â€“ Problem Solutions (Morris Mano, 5th Edition)

This repository contains Verilog-based solutions to selected problems from the textbook:

**_Digital Design, 5th Edition by M. Morris Mano and Michael D. Ciletti_**

## ðŸ“˜ About

The purpose of this repository is to document and practice solving digital logic design problems using Verilog HDL. Each module and testbench corresponds to a specific problem or concept from the book.

Topics include:
- Logic gates
- Encoders & decoders
- Adders & subtractors
- Multiplexers
- Sequential circuits
- Arithmetic logic units
- Flip-flops, registers, counters

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Verilog 
- EDA Playground / Icarus Verilog
